title: pgAdmin 4 - worst software ever?
---

I have been working on few projects with PostgreSQL. Previously I have used mainly MySQL or similar, however nothing bad to say about postgres.

**Except one thing... pgAdmin.**

It is the graphical UI used for controlling postgres database. It has all the required features and in that way, it works. 
However it's not native application, instead it's created using web technologies and NW.js.

It's probably the most annoying application I have used in many years. Everything works slowly, it has no usual shortcuts like CTRL+W and the common usability is piece of crap.

Just wanted to say this aloud. [And it seems I'm not alone](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14884713). Now trying the good old HeidiSQL for also postgres and god damn, it's so wonderful to use!
